 # üå™Ô∏è HydroGuard

## üìò Project Overview
**HydroGuard** is a typhoon risk assessment tool that enables users to input a destination and time period to evaluate potential danger. The system retrieves the **instantaneous maximum wind acceleration** (Áû¨ÈñìÊúÄÂº∑Âä†ÈÄüÂ∫¶), a key indicator of sudden and intense typhoon force that often goes unnoticed in traditional forecasting.

---

## üéØ Purpose
Conventional typhoon forecasts primarily report sustained wind speeds, which may not reflect short bursts of extreme danger. HydroGuard fills this gap by focusing on **instantaneous maximum wind acceleration**, offering:

- A clearer picture of typhoon impact during peak gusts
- Targeted, location-specific risk assessments
- Decision support for travel, logistics, and emergency planning

## üß† Machine Learning Component

This project incorporates a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** as the backend model to analyze and predict weather-related risk metrics. The DNN is trained on historical typhoon datasets to capture complex patterns in atmospheric behavior and wind acceleration trends.

## üß≠ Key Features

- üìç **Location & Time-Based Input**  
  Enter destination coordinates or region and a time range.

- üå™ **Instantaneous Maximum Wind Acceleration Calculation**  
  Identify peak gust-based acceleration metrics over short durations.

- üìä **DNN-Based Risk Estimation**  
  Predict and visualize risk levels using a trained deep learning model.

## üîß How It Works

1. **User Inputs**  
   Specify destination and time period via interface or command line.

2. **Data Collection**  
   Pull weather data (wind speeds, pressure, timestamps) from open APIs or datasets.

3. **Model Prediction (DNN)**  
   Use a trained DNN to estimate acceleration and forecast danger.

4. **Risk Output**  
   Classify danger level (e.g., Low, Medium, High) and display acceleration value.

## ‚úÖ Example Use Case

```bash
# Example (CLI or interface):
Destination: Okinawa, Japan
Period: 2024-09-10 to 2024-09-13

> Predicted Max Wind Acceleration: 18.2 m/s¬≤
> Risk Level: ‚ö†Ô∏è High
